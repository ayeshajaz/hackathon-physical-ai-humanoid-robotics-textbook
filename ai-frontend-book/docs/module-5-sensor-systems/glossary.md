# Glossary: Sensor Systems Terms

## A

**Accuracy**: The degree to which a sensor's measurements match the true value of the quantity being measured.

## B

**Bias**: A systematic error in sensor measurements that causes readings to deviate consistently from the true value.

## C

**Calibration**: The process of adjusting sensor parameters to correct for systematic errors and ensure accurate measurements.

## D

**Data Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sources to achieve improved accuracy and reliability.

**Depth Sensor**: A sensor that measures the distance to objects in a scene, providing per-pixel depth information.

## E

**Encoder**: A sensor that measures the position or speed of a rotating shaft, commonly used to measure joint angles in robots.

**Environmental Sensor**: A sensor that measures properties of the environment external to the robot, such as temperature or humidity.

## F

**Feature Extraction**: The process of identifying and extracting relevant patterns from raw sensor data.

**Filter**: A mathematical or computational process that removes noise or unwanted components from sensor data.

**Force/Torque Sensor**: A sensor that measures the forces and torques applied to a robot's end-effector or joints.

## G

**Gyroscope**: A sensor that measures angular velocity or rate of rotation.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with a human-like body structure, designed to interact with human environments and tools.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes magnetic field.

**Inertial Sensor**: A sensor that measures motion and orientation based on inertia, including accelerometers and gyroscopes.

## J

**Joint Encoder**: A sensor that measures the position of a robot's joint, typically using optical or magnetic sensing.

**LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with laser light and measuring the reflection.

## M

**Motor Current Sensor**: A sensor that measures the electrical current drawn by a motor, which correlates with the applied force or torque.

## N

**Noise**: Random variations in sensor measurements that do not represent the true value of the measured quantity.

## O

**Outlier**: A sensor measurement that deviates significantly from other measurements and is likely erroneous.

## P

**Perception Pipeline**: A sequence of processing stages that transform raw sensor data into meaningful environmental understanding.

**Physical AI**: The integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, particularly robots that must interact with the real world.

**Point Cloud**: A set of data points in space, typically representing the external surface of an object as captured by 3D scanning devices.

**Proprioceptive Sensor**: A sensor that measures the internal state of a robot, such as joint positions or motor currents.

**Sensor**: A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.
