# Glossary

## A

**Articulation Body**: A Unity component that provides advanced joint physics simulation capabilities for robotic systems, introduced in Unity 2020.1.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical system that uses real-time data to enable understanding, prediction, and optimization of the physical counterpart.

## G

**Gazebo**: A physics simulation engine that provides realistic multi-body physics simulation, high-quality rendering capabilities, and sensor simulation for robotics applications.

## H

**HRI (Human-Robot Interaction)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots, including design of interfaces, communication protocols, and behavioral patterns.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A device that measures acceleration and angular velocity, used for localization, stabilization, and motion tracking in robotics.

**Inertial Properties**: Physical properties of an object including mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia that determine how it responds to forces and torques.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A sensing method that measures distances using laser pulses, commonly used for mapping, navigation, and obstacle detection.

## P

**Physics Simulation**: The computational modeling of physical phenomena including motion, forces, collisions, and material properties in a virtual environment.

**Point Cloud**: A set of data points in 3D space representing the external surfaces of objects, commonly generated by LiDAR and depth sensors.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

**ROS-TCP-Connector**: A Unity package that enables communication between Unity and ROS systems via TCP/IP protocol.

## S

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: An XML-based format for describing simulation environments, models, and physics properties in Gazebo.

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to improve accuracy and reliability of perception systems.

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing a robot model including kinematic and dynamic properties, visual appearance, and collision geometry.

**Unity**: A real-time 3D development platform used for creating games, simulations, and human-robot interaction interfaces.

## V

**Visualization**: The representation of sensor data, robot state, or environmental information in a graphical format for human interpretation.
