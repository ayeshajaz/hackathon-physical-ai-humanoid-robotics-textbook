# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI textbook, focusing on digital twin simulation for humanoid robotics using Gazebo and Unity. This module builds upon the ROS 2 foundations from Module 1 and introduces the critical concepts of physics simulation, environment building, sensor integration, and human-robot interaction.

## About This Module

This module is designed for AI and robotics students transitioning from software-only AI to simulation-driven humanoid robotics. You'll learn to create high-fidelity digital twins that bridge the gap between virtual and physical robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Create physics simulations** using Gazebo for realistic robot-environment interactions
2. **Build immersive environments** in Unity for human-robot interaction
3. **Simulate sensors** like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU for perception tasks
4. **Integrate systems** across Gazebo and Unity for comprehensive digital twins
5. **Validate simulation results** against real-world expectations

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### [Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation)
Learn the fundamentals of physics simulation using Gazebo, including world creation, robot model configuration, and parameter tuning for realistic behavior.

### [Chapter 2: Unity Environment & Human-Robot Interaction](./unity-hri)
Explore creating immersive 3D environments in Unity and implementing human-robot interaction scenarios with high-fidelity visualization.

### [Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation)
Understand how to simulate real-world sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU in both Gazebo and Unity environments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Fundamental knowledge of 3D concepts and physics principles
- Basic familiarity with command-line tools

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation) to establish the foundation for realistic physics simulation. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, so we recommend following the sequence for the best learning experience.
