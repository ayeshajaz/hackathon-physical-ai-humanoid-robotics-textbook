# Synthetic Data Generation Flow Diagram

This file would contain a visualization of the synthetic data generation pipeline showing:

- 3D scene generation in Isaac Sim
- Domain randomization process
- Sensor simulation (cameras, LiDAR, IMU)
- Data annotation and labeling
- Dataset export for ML training
