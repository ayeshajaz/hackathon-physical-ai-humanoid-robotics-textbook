# Glossary

## A

**AI Robot Brain**: The integrated system of perception, planning, and control algorithms that enables intelligent robot behavior, typically implemented using AI techniques running on the robot's computing platform.

**Architecture**: The fundamental structure of the Isaac ecosystem, including Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Isaac Apps, and how they interact with the broader robotics ecosystem.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical system that uses real-time data to enable understanding, prediction, and optimization of the physical counterpart.

**Domain Randomization**: A technique used in simulation to randomly vary the visual and physical properties of the environment to improve the transfer of models trained on synthetic data to the real world.

## I

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's reference simulation application for robotics, built on the Omniverse platform, providing photorealistic, physics-based environments for developing, testing, and validating AI-based robotics applications.

**Isaac ROS**: A collection of hardware accelerated perception, manipulation, and navigation packages built on the NVIDIA AI stack and designed to run on Isaac-enabled robots.

**Isaac Apps**: Reference applications built using Isaac SDK that demonstrate various robotics capabilities and serve as starting points for custom robot applications.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A sensing technology that measures distance using laser light, commonly used in robotics for mapping and obstacle detection.

## N

**Nav2**: The ROS 2 Navigation Stack, providing localization, mapping, and path planning capabilities for mobile robots.

## P

**Photorealistic Simulation**: Simulation that aims to replicate the visual appearance of the real world with high fidelity, often used for generating synthetic training data.

## S

**Simulation-to-Reality Transfer**: The process of ensuring that behaviors learned or validated in simulation work effectively on real robots.

**Synthetic Data**: Artificially generated data that mimics real-world data, often used for training machine learning models when real data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

## V

**VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technique that uses visual sensors to simultaneously estimate the robot's pose and construct a map of the environment.

**VDB (Vision Data Base)**: NVIDIA's technology for sparse volumetric data representation used in 3D reconstruction and mapping.
