# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI textbook, focusing on digital twin simulation for humanoid robotics using NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. This module builds upon the simulation foundations from Module 2 and introduces advanced concepts in AI-driven robotics, including synthetic data generation, perception pipelines, and navigation systems.

## About This Module

This module is designed for AI and robotics students transitioning from simulation-based robotics to AI-driven perception, navigation, and training workflows. You'll learn to create high-fidelity digital twins that bridge the gap between virtual and physical robotic systems using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Use Isaac Sim** for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. **Implement perception algorithms** using Isaac ROS with GPU acceleration
3. **Create navigation systems** with Nav2 integrated with Isaac ROS
4. **Generate synthetic datasets** for training perception models
5. **Integrate perception and navigation** for complete AI-driven robot systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data](./isaac-sim-synthetic-data)
Learn the fundamentals of Isaac Sim for generating synthetic data, including photorealistic simulation environments and domain randomization techniques for training perception algorithms.

### [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS Perception & VSLAM](./isaac-ros-perception)
Explore Isaac ROS for implementing perception pipelines and accelerated VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for robot navigation and environment understanding.

### [Chapter 3: Navigation & Path Planning with Nav2](./nav2-navigation)
Understand how to implement navigation and path planning systems using Nav2 integrated with Isaac ROS for humanoid robot navigation in complex environments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Fundamental knowledge of simulation concepts (covered in Module 2)
- Basic familiarity with 3D concepts and physics principles

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data](./isaac-sim-synthetic-data) to learn about photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, so we recommend following the sequence for the best learning experience.
