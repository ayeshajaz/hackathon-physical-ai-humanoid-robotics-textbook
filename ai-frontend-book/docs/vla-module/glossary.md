# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) related terminology used throughout the module. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

## A

### Action Component
The component of a VLA system responsible for executing physical or simulated actions based on interpreted instructions and environmental context.

### Autonomous Behavior
A complete robotic behavior system that integrates vision, language, and action in response to environmental stimuli and commands without continuous human intervention.

## B

### Behavior Tree
A hierarchical structure used in robotics and AI to organize and execute complex behaviors, particularly useful for autonomous humanoid decision-making.

## C

### Computer Vision
A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world, used in the vision component of VLA systems.

## D

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns, foundational to both vision and language components in VLA systems.

## E

### End-to-End Learning
An approach where a system learns to perform a task from raw input to desired output without manual feature engineering, often applied in VLA systems.

## F

### Fine-tuning
The process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task or domain, commonly used with large language models in VLA systems.

## G

### Generative AI
AI systems that can generate new content such as text, images, or actions based on learned patterns, including large language models used in VLA planning.

## H

### Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The study of interactions between humans and robots, a key application area for VLA systems that process voice commands and respond appropriately.

## I

### Intent Classification
The process of identifying the purpose or goal behind a user's input, essential for understanding voice commands in VLA systems.

## L

### Large Language Model (LLM)
Advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text, used in VLA systems for planning and decision-making.

### Language Component
The component of a VLA system that processes natural language input and generates appropriate responses or action plans.

## N

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language, essential for the language component of VLA systems.

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
A subfield of NLP focused on interpreting the meaning of human language, crucial for voice command processing in VLA systems.

## P

### Perception Processing
The analysis and interpretation of sensory data (especially visual) to understand the environment, forming the vision component of VLA systems.

### Planning Architecture
The system design that determines how high-level goals are converted into executable actions, often using LLMs in VLA systems.

## R

### ROS 2 Action
A communication pattern in ROS 2 that allows for long-running operations with feedback, goal management, and preemption, used for voice-driven command execution.

### Robotic Planning
The process of determining a sequence of actions to achieve a goal, often enhanced by LLMs in VLA systems for more sophisticated decision-making.

## S

### Speech Recognition
The technology that converts spoken language into text, the first step in processing voice commands for VLA systems.

### State Machine
A computational model used to design algorithms that can be in one of a finite number of states at any given time, used in autonomous humanoid behavior management.

## V

### Vision Component
The component of a VLA system that processes visual information from cameras and sensors to understand the environment.

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System
An integrated system that combines computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action execution to enable sophisticated human-robot interaction.

### Voice Command Interface
A system component that processes spoken instructions and converts them to robotic action plans, bridging human language and robot capabilities.

### Voice-to-Action Mapping
The process of converting natural language voice commands into executable robotic actions, a key function in VLA systems.

## W

### Whisper (Speech Model)
An example of a large-scale speech recognition model that can convert audio to text, used in the speech recognition component of VLA systems.
