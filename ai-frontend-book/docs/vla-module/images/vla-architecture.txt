VLA Architecture Diagram Description

Title: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System Architecture

Description: This diagram illustrates the architecture of a Vision-Language-Action system with three main interconnected components:

1. Vision Component (Left side)
   - Input: Cameras, sensors
   - Processing: Computer vision, object detection, scene understanding
   - Output: Environmental perception data

2. Language Component (Center)
   - Input: Natural language commands, environmental context
   - Processing: Large Language Model (LLM), natural language understanding
   - Output: Action plans, semantic understanding

3. Action Component (Right side)
   - Input: Action plans from LLM
   - Processing: Motion planning, control execution
   - Output: Robot actions, movements

Arrows show data flow:
- Vision → Language: Environmental context
- Language → Action: Action plans
- Action → Environment: Robot behavior
- Environment → Vision: Continuous perception

Feedback loops connect all components for adaptive behavior.
