# Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI Textbook, focusing on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robots. This module explores the integration of large language models with robotic perception and action systems, enabling sophisticated human-robot interaction and autonomous behavior.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent a cutting-edge approach to robotics that combines:
- **Vision**: Advanced computer vision for environmental perception
- **Language**: Large language models for understanding and planning
- **Action**: Robotic action execution in physical space

This integration enables robots to understand complex human instructions, perceive their environment, and execute appropriate actions in response.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture of VLA systems and their components
- Implement voice-driven command processing for humanoid robots
- Integrate large language models with robotic planning systems
- Build complete autonomous humanoid behaviors
- Evaluate and validate VLA system performance

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic ROS 2 knowledge
- Understanding of robotics fundamentals
- Programming skills in Python or C++
- Familiarity with the previous modules in this textbook

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **VLA Foundations**: Understanding the architecture and system flow
2. **Voice Commands & LLM-Based Planning**: Implementing voice interfaces and AI planning
3. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid**: Complete integration and autonomous behavior

Let's begin exploring the foundations of Vision-Language-Action systems!
