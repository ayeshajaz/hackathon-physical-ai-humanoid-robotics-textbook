# Glossary

## A

**Action**: An asynchronous, goal-oriented communication pattern in ROS 2 that includes feedback, result, and status information.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: A middleware standard for distributed real-time systems that serves as the foundation for ROS 2's communication layer.

**Debug nodes**: Nodes used for debugging and visualization purposes, such as rqt or rviz.

## L

**Launch file**: A configuration file that specifies how to start multiple ROS 2 nodes together with their parameters and configurations.

## M

**Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications beyond what's offered by the operating system, specifically DDS in the case of ROS 2.

## N

**Node**: A process that performs computation in ROS. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS system.

## P

**Package**: A modular unit of organization in ROS containing libraries, executables, scripts, or other resources.

**Parameter**: A configuration value that can be changed at runtime without recompiling the code.

**Publisher**: A node that sends messages to a topic.

## Q

**QoS (Quality of Service)**: A set of policies that define how messages are delivered in terms of reliability, latency, durability, and other characteristics.

## S

**Service**: A synchronous request-response communication pattern in ROS 2.

**Subscriber**: A node that receives messages from a topic.

## T

**Topic**: A named bus over which nodes exchange messages in a publisher-subscriber pattern.
