# Humanoid Robot Communication Diagram

This file would contain a visual representation of how ROS 2 is used in a humanoid robot showing:
- Sensors distributed throughout the robot body (cameras, IMU, joint encoders)
- Processing units (head, torso, limbs)
- Communication patterns between components
- Example topics for sensor data and control commands
- Safety monitoring systems
