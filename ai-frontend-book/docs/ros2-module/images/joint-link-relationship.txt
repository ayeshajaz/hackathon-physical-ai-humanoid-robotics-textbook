# Joint and Link Relationship Diagram

This file would contain a visual representation of how joints connect links in a robot structure showing:
- Parent and child links in joint definitions
- Different joint types (revolute, prismatic, fixed, etc.)
- Joint axes and ranges of motion
- Coordinate system transformations
- Example kinematic chains

[Diagram showing different joint types and how they connect links with their degrees of freedom]
