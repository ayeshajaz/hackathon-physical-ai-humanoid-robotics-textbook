# Glossary: Locomotion Terms

## A

**Ankle Strategy**: A balance recovery mechanism that uses ankle torques to adjust posture and maintain balance without taking a step.

## B

**Balance**: The ability to maintain the body's center of mass within the base of support.

**Balance Recovery**: The process of returning to a stable state after a disturbance has compromised stability.

## C

**Center of Mass (CoM)**: The point where the robot's mass is concentrated; critical for stability during locomotion.

**Capture Point**: The location where a robot must step to come to a complete stop without falling.

**Compliance**: The ability of a system to adapt to forces and maintain stable interaction with the environment.

## D

**Dynamics**: The study of motion considering the forces and torques that cause the motion.

## E

## F

**Feedback Control**: A control approach that uses sensor measurements to adjust the robot's behavior in real-time.

**Feedforward Control**: A control approach that anticipates required control actions based on planned trajectories and known system dynamics.

**Foot Placement Strategy**: Techniques for determining where and when to place feet during locomotion to maintain balance.

## G

**Gait**: The pattern of limb movements used for locomotion.

**Gait Cycle**: The sequence of movements that constitutes one complete step cycle in walking.

## H

**Hip Strategy**: A balance recovery mechanism that uses hip and trunk movements to adjust the center of mass position.

## I

**Inverse Dynamics**: Computing required torques for desired motion based on robot dynamics models.

## J

## K

## L

**Locomotion**: The ability to move from one place to another; in robotics, the mechanisms and control strategies that enable robot movement.

## M

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: A control strategy that predicts and optimizes future behavior based on system models.

## N

## O

**Obstacle Avoidance**: Planning and control strategies to navigate around obstacles during locomotion.

## P

**Path Planning**: Determining the overall route the robot should follow to reach its destination while avoiding obstacles.

**PID Control**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control, a feedback control mechanism.

## Q

## R

**Reactive Control**: Control strategies that respond to sensed disturbances or changes in the environment.

**Recovery Strategy**: Methods used to restore balance when stability is compromised.

## S

**Static Walking**: Walking where the center of mass remains within the support polygon at all times.

**Stability Margin**: The distance between the center of mass projection and the edge of the support polygon.

**Stepping Strategy**: A balance recovery mechanism that involves taking a step to expand the support polygon.

**Support Polygon**: The area bounded by the points of contact between the robot and the ground.

## T

**Trajectory Generation**: Creating detailed movement sequences that the robot can follow to execute planned paths.

## U

## V

**Virtual Model Control**: A control approach that uses simplified models to generate stable locomotion behaviors.

## W

**Walking**: A gait pattern involving alternating steps to achieve forward motion.

**Whole-Body Control**: Control strategies that coordinate multiple joints and body parts simultaneously.

## X

## Y

## Z

**Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: The point on the ground where the net moment of the ground reaction forces is zero; critical for stability in humanoid locomotion.
