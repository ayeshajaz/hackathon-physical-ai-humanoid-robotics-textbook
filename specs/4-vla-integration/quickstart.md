# Quickstart Guide: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

**Feature**: Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Created**: 2025-12-21
**Status**: Completed

## Getting Started with VLA Module

This quickstart guide provides instructions for students to begin learning about Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robots.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the VLA module, students should have:

1. **Basic ROS 2 Knowledge**: Understanding of ROS 2 concepts, nodes, topics, and services
2. **Robotics Fundamentals**: Knowledge of basic robotics concepts including perception, planning, and action
3. **Programming Skills**: Proficiency in Python or C++ for implementing examples
4. **Docusaurus Navigation**: Ability to navigate the textbook documentation system

### Learning Path

Follow this recommended sequence to complete the VLA module:

1. **Chapter 1: Vision-Language-Action Foundations**
   - Study the VLA system architecture
   - Understand the data flow between vision, language, and action components
   - Complete the foundational exercises
   - Take the Chapter 1 assessment

2. **Chapter 2: Voice Commands & LLM-Based Planning**
   - Learn about voice command processing
   - Understand LLM integration with robotic planning
   - Implement ROS 2 action interfaces
   - Complete the voice command exercises
   - Take the Chapter 2 assessment

3. **Chapter 3: Capstone – Autonomous Humanoid**
   - Integrate all VLA concepts
   - Implement a complete autonomous humanoid system
   - Test and validate the complete system
   - Complete the capstone project assessment

### Technical Setup

The VLA module uses standard robotics tools and frameworks:

- **ROS 2**: For robotic system integration
- **Large Language Models**: For planning and decision making
- **Speech Recognition**: For voice command processing
- **Docusaurus**: For documentation and examples

All examples in this module are designed to work with standard ROS 2 installations and common open-source tools.

### Expected Outcomes

After completing the VLA module, students will be able to:

1. Explain the architecture of Vision-Language-Action systems
2. Implement voice-driven command processing for humanoid robots
3. Integrate large language models with robotic planning systems
4. Build complete autonomous humanoid behaviors
5. Evaluate and validate VLA system performance
