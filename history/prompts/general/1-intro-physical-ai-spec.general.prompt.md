# Prompt History Record

## Summary
Created a comprehensive specification for the Introduction Page: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics feature. The specification includes user scenarios, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria. It defines the feature as a Docusaurus-compatible introduction page that welcomes AI learners and beginners in humanoid robotics, defines Physical AI as embodied intelligence, explains the importance of humanoid robotics, provides an overview of the 6-module structure, describes the learning approach and prerequisites, and offers a smooth transition to Module 1.

## Context
The user requested creation of a book-level introduction page for a Physical AI textbook that would appear before Module 1. The page needed to define Physical AI as embodied intelligence, explain the importance of humanoid robotics, and present the overall learning journey of the book with 6 modules.

## Action Taken
Generated a complete feature specification following the template structure, including:
- User scenarios with priorities and acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements with clear testable statements
- Key entities involved in the feature
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes

## Outcome
Successfully created the feature specification for the Physical AI introduction page. The specification is comprehensive, testable, and ready for the planning phase.

## Evaluation
The specification meets all requirements with clear user scenarios, functional requirements, and measurable success criteria. It properly targets the intended audience and addresses all required structural elements.
