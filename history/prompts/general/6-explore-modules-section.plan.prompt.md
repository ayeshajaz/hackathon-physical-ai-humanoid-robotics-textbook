# explore-modules-section

## Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response
Successfully completed the planning phase for the "Explore All Modules" homepage section. Created the following artifacts:

1. Implementation plan (plan.md) - Outlines technical approach, constitution check, and project structure
2. Research document (research.md) - Details implementation approaches, best practices, and technology considerations
3. Data model (data-model.md) - Defines the structure for the module cards and section
4. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) - Step-by-step implementation guide with code examples
5. Contracts directory - Placeholder for any interface contracts (not applicable for this UI-only feature)

The plan follows Docusaurus conventions with a custom React component approach, ensuring responsive design, accessibility, and clean academic styling as specified. All constitution checks pass, confirming the approach aligns with project principles.

## Outcome
Planning phase completed successfully with all required artifacts created. Ready to proceed to task generation phase.
