# Prompt History Record

## Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Introduction Page: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics feature. The plan includes technical context, constitution check, research summary, data model, quickstart guide, implementation approach, and validation strategy. All required artifacts have been created: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, and quickstart.md.

## Context
The user requested creation of an implementation plan for a book-level introduction page for a Physical AI textbook that would appear before Module 1. The page needed to define Physical AI as embodied intelligence, explain the importance of humanoid robotics, and present the overall learning journey of the book with 6 modules.

## Action Taken
Generated a complete implementation plan following the template structure, including:
- Technical context and constitution check
- Research summary with key decisions
- Data model for the introduction page entity
- Quickstart guide with implementation steps
- Implementation approach and validation strategy

## Outcome
Successfully created the implementation plan for the Physical AI introduction page. All required planning artifacts are complete and the feature is ready for the task generation phase.

## Evaluation
The plan comprehensively addresses all aspects of the feature implementation, with proper research, design, and validation strategies. It maintains alignment with project constitution principles and is ready for task breakdown.
