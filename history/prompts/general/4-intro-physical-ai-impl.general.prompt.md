# Prompt History Record

## Summary
Successfully implemented the introduction page for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Created a comprehensive introduction page (physical-ai-intro.md) with proper Docusaurus front-matter, including all six required sections: welcome/purpose, Physical AI definition, importance of humanoid robotics, 6-module overview, learning approach/prerequisites, and transition to Module 1. All 30 tasks from the task list were completed, with content tailored for both AI learners transitioning to Physical AI and beginners in humanoid robotics. The page is positioned with sidebar_position: 0 to appear before Module 1.

## Context
The user requested implementation of an introduction page for a Physical AI textbook that would appear before Module 1. The page needed to define Physical AI as embodied intelligence, explain the importance of humanoid robotics, and present the overall learning journey of the book with 6 modules.

## Action Taken
Executed all 30 tasks from the task list, creating a comprehensive introduction page that includes:
- Proper Docusaurus front-matter with title and sidebar_position: 0
- All six required sections as specified in the requirements
- Content tailored for both AI learners transitioning to Physical AI and beginners in humanoid robotics
- Academic yet beginner-friendly tone maintained throughout
- No deep technical explanations, focusing on accessible concepts

## Outcome
Successfully completed implementation of the Physical AI introduction page. All functional requirements and success criteria from the specification have been met. The introduction page is now ready for integration into the Docusaurus site.

## Evaluation
The implementation fully satisfies the feature requirements with well-structured content that maintains an academic yet beginner-friendly tone. The page includes all required sections and targets both specified audiences effectively. Task completion rate was 100% (30/30 tasks completed).
