# explore-modules-section

## Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response
Successfully generated tasks for the "Explore All Modules" section feature. The tasks.md file includes:

- **Phase 1**: Setup tasks for creating directory structures
- **Phase 2**: Foundational components including CSS modules and React components
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 implementation (P1) - Homepage Module Discovery
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 implementation (P2) - Responsive Module Access
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 implementation (P3) - Academic Content Presentation
- **Phase 6**: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

The tasks follow the checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Parallel execution opportunities were identified (e.g., T002 and T003, T003 and T004), and dependencies are documented. The MVP scope focuses on User Story 1 to deliver core functionality first.

## Outcome
Task generation completed successfully with 30 specific, actionable tasks in the proper format. Ready to proceed with implementation following the phased approach.
