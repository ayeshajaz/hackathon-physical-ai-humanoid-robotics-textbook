# Prompt History Record

## Summary
Created a comprehensive task list for the Introduction Page: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics feature. The tasks follow a phased approach: Setup (T001-T003), Foundational (T004-T006), User Story 1 - Book Introduction Access (T007-T016), User Story 2 - Module Structure Overview (T017-T020), User Story 3 - Learning Prerequisites and Approach (T021-T024), and Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T025-T030). All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file references where applicable.

## Context
The user requested creation of a task list for the book-level introduction page for a Physical AI textbook that would appear before Module 1. The page needed to define Physical AI as embodied intelligence, explain the importance of humanoid robotics, and present the overall learning journey of the book with 6 modules.

## Action Taken
Generated a complete task list following the template structure, including:
- Setup tasks for project initialization
- Foundational tasks that block all user stories
- User story-specific tasks organized by priority (P1, P2, P3)
- Polish and cross-cutting concerns
- All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs and story labels

## Outcome
Successfully created the task list for the Physical AI introduction page. The tasks are organized by phase and user story priority, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. The feature is ready for implementation.

## Evaluation
The task list comprehensively covers all aspects of the feature implementation, with proper organization by user story priority. All tasks follow the required checklist format and are specific enough for execution. The phased approach enables incremental delivery starting with the MVP (User Story 1).
