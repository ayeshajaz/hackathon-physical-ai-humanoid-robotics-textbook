## Prompt

Module 6: Locomotion

Target audience:
- AI and robotics students exploring movement, balance, and mobility in humanoid robots.

Focus:
- Fundamentals of humanoid locomotion
- Balance, gait, and stability concepts
- Locomotion planning and control at a high level

Structure (Docusaurus):
- Chapter 1: Locomotion Fundamentals
- Chapter 2: Gait, Balance, and Stability
- Chapter 3: Locomotion Planning & Control
- Tech: Docusaurus (all files in .md).

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for Module 6: Locomotion focusing on educational content for AI and robotics students. The specification includes user scenarios, functional requirements, and measurable success criteria for learning about locomotion fundamentals, gait and balance, and locomotion planning and control in humanoid robots.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete spec for locomotion module with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: None required for specification creation
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in specs/6-locomotion/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully transformed educational module requirements into structured specification
