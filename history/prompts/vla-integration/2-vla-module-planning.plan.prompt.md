# PHR: vla-module-planning

## Outcome
Successfully created the implementation plan for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA). The plan includes technical context, constitution check, research findings, data model, and quickstart guide for creating educational content about VLA pipelines, voice commands with LLM-based planning, and autonomous humanoid behavior.

## Evaluation
The implementation plan comprehensively covers all aspects of the VLA module creation, from architectural decisions to content structure. It follows constitutional principles and provides clear guidance for implementation of the three-chapter module.

## Prompt Text
