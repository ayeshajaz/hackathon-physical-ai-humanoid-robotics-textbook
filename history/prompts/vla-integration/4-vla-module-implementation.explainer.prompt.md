# PHR: vla-module-implementation

## Outcome
Successfully implemented Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for the physical AI textbook. Created complete educational content including three chapters (foundations, voice commands & LLM planning, capstone autonomous humanoid), supporting materials (glossary, summary, assessment), and code examples for all topics. All 50 tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as done.

## Evaluation
The VLA module implementation is complete and ready for use. The content covers all required topics with proper educational progression from foundations to advanced integration. All code examples are functional and demonstrate the concepts taught in each chapter. The module is properly integrated into the Docusaurus navigation system.

## Prompt Text
