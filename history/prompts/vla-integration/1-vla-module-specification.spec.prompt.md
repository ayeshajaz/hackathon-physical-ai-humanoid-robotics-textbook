# PHR: vla-module-specification

## Outcome
Successfully created the specification for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for the physical AI textbook project. The specification includes user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria for educational content covering VLA pipelines, voice commands with LLM-based planning, and autonomous humanoid behavior.

## Evaluation
The specification meets all quality criteria with clear user scenarios, measurable success criteria, and well-defined functional requirements. The content is technology-agnostic and focuses on educational outcomes for AI and robotics students.

## Prompt Text
```
