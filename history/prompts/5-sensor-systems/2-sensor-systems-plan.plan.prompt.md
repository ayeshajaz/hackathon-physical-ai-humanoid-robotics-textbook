## Prompt

Module 5 – Sensor Systems

- Create Module 5 documentation in Docusaurus as part of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.
- Add three .md chapters covering sensor fundamentals, humanoid sensor types, and sensor data integration for perception and decision-making.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 5 - Sensor Systems including: implementation plan (plan.md), research document (research.md), data model (data-model.md), and quickstart guide (quickstart.md). The plan follows the Docusaurus documentation structure and addresses all requirements from the specification.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete planning artifacts for sensor systems module with technical approach, research, data models, and quickstart guide
- 🧪 Tests: None required for planning artifacts
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, and quickstart.md in specs/5-sensor-systems/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation phase (/sp.tasks)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully planned documentation module with appropriate technical context and constitution compliance

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
