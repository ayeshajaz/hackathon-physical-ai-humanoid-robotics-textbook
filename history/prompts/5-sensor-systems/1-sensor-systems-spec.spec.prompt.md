## Prompt

Module 5: Sensor Systems

Target audience:
- AI and robotics students building perception and sensing understanding for humanoid robots.

Focus:
- Role of sensors in Physical AI and humanoid systems
- Common sensor types and their use-cases
- Sensor data flow for perception and decision making

Structure (Docusaurus):
- Chapter 1: Sensor Systems Fundamentals
- Chapter 2: Types of Sensors in Humanoid Robotics
- Chapter 3: Sensor Data Integration & Perception Pipeline
- Tech: Docusaurus (all files in .md)

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for Module 5: Sensor Systems focusing on educational content for AI and robotics students. The specification includes user scenarios, functional requirements, and measurable success criteria for learning about sensor systems in humanoid robotics.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete spec for sensor systems module with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: None required for specification creation
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in specs/5-sensor-systems/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully transformed educational module requirements into structured specification
